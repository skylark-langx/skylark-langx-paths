     * Solve the relative path from from to to.
     *
     * At times we have two absolute paths, and we need to derive the relative path
     * from one to the other. This is actually the reverse transform of
     * paths.resolve, which means we see that:
     *
     *    paths.resolve(from, paths.relative(from, to)) == paths.resolve(to)
     *
     * @example Usage example
     *   paths.relative('C:\\orandea\\test\\aaa', 'C:\\orandea\\impl\\bbb')
     *   // returns
     *   '..\\..\\impl\\bbb'
     *
     *   paths.relative('/data/orandea/test/aaa', '/data/orandea/impl/bbb')
     *   // returns
     *   '../../impl/bbb'
     * @param [String] from
     * @param [String] to
     * @return [String]
